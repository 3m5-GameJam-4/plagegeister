## About The Game Jam
The random topics for this game jam were:
* flying into something
* collaborate
* wave of imigration

All three topics should be integrated into the final game.

## Controls
The game was made for three players. One is playing the operator. He is observing the other two players from his own screen. Depending on the score, he is able to spawn new mobs of slimy ghosts.
* New mob for player 1: Keyboard key 1
* New mob for player 2: Keyboard key 2

The other two players can control mobs with common gamepads. They are looking on another screen. From their perspective they cannot see the nasty heros.
* The left analog stick is used to navigate the active mob.
* The L1 key is used to switch to the previous mob.
* The R1 key is used to switch to the next mob.
